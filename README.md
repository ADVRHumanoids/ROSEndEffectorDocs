# ROSEndEffectorDocs
Sphinx (with readthedocs theme) documentation for [ROSEndEffector package](https://github.com/ADVRHumanoids/ROSEndEffector)

This documentation is visible at https://advrhumanoids.github.io/ROSEndEffectorDocs/build/html/index.html


### Developer zone
To make changes:
- Do the modifications to files in docs/source
- Compile locally:
  ~~~bash
  cd [...]/ROSEndEffectorDocs/docs
  make html
  ~~~
- Commit and push the changes

Maybe there is a better/faster solution to compile + push ?
